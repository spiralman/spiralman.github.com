# About Me #

I am Thomas Stephens, a software developer in Austin, Texas. I work as
a technical lead for AMD in the software group, focusing on developing
systems to automate hardware and software testing.

These days I use C# and Windows almost exclusively at work, but I have
a Unix/C++/Perl background (with a little Java from
school). Eventually, I was cured of Perl disease and moved on to
Python and, lately, Javascript and Node. I'm always on the lookout for
new toys to play with.
