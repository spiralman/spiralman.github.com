# About Me #

I am Thomas Stephens, a software developer in Austin, Texas. I work as
a full stack developer at [uStudio](http://www.ustudio.com).

My day job involves writing Python and JavaScript, but I have written
professionally in many languages, initially C and C++, with a detour
to C#, with lots of scripting glue in Python, Ruby and, my first
programming language love, Perl (we have since parted ways). I'm
always looking to learn new things, and try new tools, so I have
dabbled in many more.
