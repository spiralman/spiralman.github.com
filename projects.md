# Projects #

These are my "nights and weekends" projects. I like to try using new
(or old) tools which I wouldn't get to use at work, but that usually
means they aren't always fully-formed.

## Unravled ##

Knitting/crochet counter app for Android (and, theoretically, iOS)
which is written in HTML5/Javascript. It uses Backbone.js as its
Javascript MV* framework and works entirely out of a static HTML page,
using localStorage for data persistence.

## WeatherNOOK ##

An Android application for fetching the current weather conditions and
forecast from NOAA. It's specifically optimized for the B&N Nook
Tablet, and I wrote it because there weren't any good (free) weather
applications in the B&N store.

## Color Mask ##

A Python/Cocoa application for automatically generating masks suitable
for making screen-printing screens from photographs. It uses PyObjc
and the included Cocoa bindings for the UI, and some custom CoreImage
filters (which are a subset of OpenGL Shaders) to calculate the image
mask.
