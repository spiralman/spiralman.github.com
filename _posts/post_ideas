* Content vs Widget layouts
* Sibling-relative layouts
* Grid Layouts
** Same idea
** Bootstrap, etc too large-grained
* Fake it in JS
** Slow?
** Mobile responsiveness (built-in to browser)

App themes
* Differentiation
* Desktop is ugly
** Because you see multiple apps at once
* Mobile is nice
** Because you only see one app at a time

Icon Fonts
* Scaling and color
* Designing in Inkscape
* Fontforge for creation
* Scripting

Dynamic Languages
* Asking the right questions
** Type vs has property
* Static typing is a lie
* Downcasting in static languages

The making and the product
* Quote
* Coding on weekends
** Why should it be any less interesting?
** New tools/ideas
* 

Front End Unit Testing
* Should we?
* Fragility
* Catching useful failures
* descriptive?
